1) In the Bank.kt, i have not defined any getter because, I've used "val" keyword for this, so kotlin will
generate default getter for you. and if you're using var than kotlin will generate auto setter for you.

2) Data class automatically  have equals, hashcode and toString function. So, don't need to mention again.

3) In the architecture diagram, we are following bottom up approach. i.e. first data layer, then data source,
 then service layer, then web layer.
